Final project of the Data Science Bootcamp. 

We coded a cool Deepfake detector app. Feed it an image and know if the image is real of if it has been altered by deepfake technology.

We used Python as a language, Tensoflow to build our model, Fast API for the API and Streamlit for the simple web app. Our accuracy is 75%.
