Final project of the Data Science Bootcamp. 

We coded a cool Deepfake detector app. Feed it an image and know if the image is real of if it has been altered by deepfake technology.

Scripts for the Dataset creation and the Deep Learning model initialization and training are situated in the ml_logic folder.

We used Python as a language, Tensoflow to build our model, Fast API for the API and Streamlit for the simple web app. Our accuracy is 75%.
